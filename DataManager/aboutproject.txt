Connect (with authorization if needed, ability to securely save credentials for later use) to multiple data sources – Amazon S3, MS SQL, CSV, Excel, Cassandra, JSON etc.
Display available data (tables, files, etc.)
Preview the data (transform if needed for preview, i.e. JSON to Table)
Select/create destination (with authorization if needed)
Customize the transformation (i.e. JSON to CSV with custom row and column separators)
Move transformed data to destination and validate correctness of migration.
Should have a nice UI in any form – web, windows forms, AIR – the choice is yours
